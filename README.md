## Problem Description
The relevant situation is that our client, the owner and chairman of Srini's Country Club, Dr. Nikhil Srinivasan, needed a relational database to track important data for his growing business. The central entity in the model is the Members entity because the members drive the revenue and activities of the entire business. The Members entity is directly tied to the Equipment, Guests, Memberships, and Instructors entities and associatively related to TeeTimes, Tournaments, and Events. We are interested in modeling these essential relationships, generating dummy data, and infusing the entities and their attributes with the corresponding data points. Most importantly, we intend to create multiple queries that provide crucial insights into Srini's Country Club, particularly data points linked to the Members, with the goal of identifying which areas of the business to optimize in the future.
